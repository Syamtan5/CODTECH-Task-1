## Project Structure

- **styles.css:** Contains the CSS for styling the application.
- **script.js:** Contains the JavaScript for adding and removing tasks.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file includes a container div that holds the title, input section, and task list.
- The input section includes an input field for entering new tasks and a button for adding tasks.
- The task list is an unordered list that will display the tasks added by the user.

## CSS Styling

- The container is styled with padding, border-radius, and a box-shadow to make it visually appealing.
- The input section and task list items are styled to be user-friendly and responsive.
- Buttons are styled with hover effects to improve the user experience.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file adds event listeners to handle the addition and deletion of tasks.
- The `addTask` function adds a new task to the list if the input field is not empty.
- Each task item has a delete button that removes the task from the list when clicked.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field.
3. Click the "Add" button or press the Enter key to add the task to the list.
4. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

## Future Enhancements
